# Bio-and-Resume

In my early years, I was formally trained as a social scientist, mathematical sociologist, and statistician and applied this training both in academics and the commercial software industry for 45 years (for an overview see the diagram below, for the details see my <a href='https://github.com/daveking63/Bio-and-Resume/blob/master/David%20King%20Resume%20-%202018.pdf'>resume</a>. Over those 45 years I picked up specialized knowledge in databases (SQL and NoSQL), natural language processing, AI, machine learning and data mining, image processing, data visualization, infographics, and a very long laundry list of computer programming languages (65+ at last count). 

At the end of 2014, I officially retired.  Since my retirement, I have devoted much of my time to various research projects focused on applying this specialized knowledge to the data and visual mining of social media of various sorts and to the areas of algorithmic and generative art. Towards this end, I formed an LLC called *Dataffiti* devoted to these research endeavors. For a description of many of the projects I have undertaken, see the other repositories at <a href='https://github.com/daveking63'>my github site</a>.

More recently, I've also been serving as an Advisor/Board Member to a startup company called *Teuvonet Technologies LLC*. Teuvonet is focused on the development of artificial intelligence and machine learning chips and SOCs for real-time analysis of data from sensory devices with the goal of detecting anomalies, failures, and providing emergency service or predictive preventative maintenance.
